# Frank Sinatra – My Way

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
MY friend I'll say it dear
I'll state my case
of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each
and every highway
And more much more
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again
too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through
without exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step
along the byway
And more much more
I did it my way
Yes there were times
I'll sure you knew
When I bit off
more than I could chew
But through it all
when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
For what is a man
what has he got
If not himself
then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words
of one who kneels
The like a chose I took brose
And did it my way
