[00:12.85] Sometimes I feel like I don't know
[00:18.14] Sometimes I feel like checking out
[00:23.31] I wanna get it wrong
[00:29.75] Can't always be strong
[00:33.20] And love it won't be long ...
[00:47.70] 
[00:55.48] Oh sugar, don't you cry
[01:02.06] Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes
[01:06.38] You know I need you to be strong
[01:10.74] And the day is dark, as the night is long
[01:15.28] Feel like trash
[01:17.32] You make me feel clean
[01:19.75] I'm in the black
[01:21.86] Can't see or be seen
[01:31.86] 
[01:24.21] Baby Baby Baby light my way
[01:31.05] Alright now, Baby Baby Baby light my way
[01:51.05] 
[01:41.55] You bury your treasure
[01:45.13] Where it can't be found
[01:49.98] But your love is like a secret
[01:54.54] That's been passed around
[01:59.09] There is a silence that comes to a house
[02:03.52] Where no-one can sleep
[02:07.14] I guess it's the price of love
[02:12.08] I know it's not cheap
[02:22.58] 
[02:14.95] Oh come on, Baby Baby Baby light my way
[02:25.13] Oh come on, Baby Baby Baby light my way
[02:34.14] Baby Baby Baby light my way
[02:47.64] 
[03:02.78] I remember
[03:08.95] When we could sleep on stones
[03:15.85] Now we lie together in whispers and moans
[03:23.57] When I was all messed up and I heard opera in my head
[03:34.22] Your love was a light bulb hanging over my bed
[03:57.22] 
[03:41.51] Baby Baby Baby
[03:49.81] Baby Baby Baby
[04:01.34] Baby Baby Baby light my way
